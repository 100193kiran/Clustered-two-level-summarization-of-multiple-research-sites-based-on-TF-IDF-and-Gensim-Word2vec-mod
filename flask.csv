0,2102.04004,WOMBAT: A fully Bayesian global flux-inversion framework,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04004,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04004,"Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Michael Bertolacci, Jenny Fisher, Ann Stavert, Matthew L. Rigby, Yi Cao, Noel Cressie","WOMBAT (the WOllongong Methodology for Bayesian Assimilation of Trace-gases) is a fully Bayesian hierarchical statistical framework for flux inversion of trace gases from flask, in situ, and remotely sensed data. WOMBAT extends the conventional Bayesian-synthesis framework through the consideration of a correlated error term, the capacity for online bias correction, and the provision of uncertainty quantification on all unknowns that appear in the Bayesian statistical model. We show, in an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE), that these extensions are crucial when the data are indeed biased and have errors that are correlated. Using the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model, we show that WOMBAT is able to obtain posterior means and uncertainties on non-fossil-fuel CO$_2$ fluxes from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) data that are comparable to those from the Model Intercomparison Project (MIP) reported in Crowell et al. (2019, Atmos. Chem. Phys., vol. 19). We also find that our predictions of out-of-sample retrievals from the Total Column Carbon Observing Network are, for the most part, more accurate than those made by the MIP participants. Subsequent versions of the OCO-2 datasets will be ingested into WOMBAT as they become available."," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None

Wright, Benjamin Joachimi, Maciej Bilicki, Nora Elisa Chisari, Andrej Dvornik, Thomas Erben, Benjamin Giblin, Catherine Heymans, Hendrik Hildebrandt, Henk Hoekstra, Shahab Joudaki, Mohammadjavad Vakili","We present a new method for the mitigation of observational systematic effects in angular galaxy clustering via corrective random galaxy catalogues. Real and synthetic galaxy data, from the Kilo Degree Survey's (KiDS) 4$^{\rm{th}}$ Data Release (KiDS-$1000$) and the Full-sky Lognormal Astro-fields Simulation Kit (FLASK) package respectively, are used to train self-organising maps (SOMs) to learn the multivariate relationships between observed galaxy number density and up to six systematic-tracer variables, including seeing, Galactic dust extinction, and Galactic stellar density. We then create `organised' randoms, i.e. random galaxy catalogues with spatially variable number densities, mimicking the learnt systematic density modes in the data. Using realistically biased mock data, we show that these organised randoms consistently subtract spurious density modes from the two-point angular correlation function $w(\vartheta)$, correcting biases of up to $12σ$ in the mean clustering amplitude to as low as $0.1σ$, over a high signal-to-noise angular range of 7-100 arcmin. Their performance is also validated for angular clustering cross-correlations in a bright, flux-limited subset of KiDS-$1000$, comparing against an analogous sample constructed from highly-complete spectroscopic redshift data. Each organised random catalogue object is a `clone' carrying the properties of a real galaxy, and is distributed throughout the survey footprint according to the parent galaxy's position in systematics-space. Thus, sub-sample randoms are readily derived from a single master random catalogue via the same selection as applied to the real galaxies. Our method is expected to improve in performance with increased survey area, galaxy number density, and systematic contamination, making organised randoms extremely promising for current and future clustering analyses of faint samples."," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None

Conboy","Flow cytometry (FCM) is an analytic technique that is capable of detecting and recording the emission of fluorescence and light scattering of cells or particles (that are collectively called ""events"") in a population. A typical FCM experiment can produce a large array of data making the analysis computationally intensive. Current FCM data analysis platforms (FlowJo, etc.), while very useful, do not allow interactive data processing online due to the data size limitations. Here we report a more effective way to analyze FCM data. Freecyto is a free, easy-to-learn, Python-flask-based web application that uses a weighted k-means clustering algorithm to facilitate the interactive analysis of flow cytometry data. A key limitation of web browsers is their inability to interactively display large amounts of data. Freecyto addresses this bottleneck through the use of the k-means algorithm to quantize the data, allowing the user to access a representative set of data points for interactive visualization of complex datasets. Moreover, Freecyto enables the interactive analyses of large complex datasets while preserving the standard FCM visualization features, such as the generation of scatterplots (dotplots), histograms, heatmaps, boxplots, as well as a SQL-based sub-population gating feature. We also show that Freecyto can be applied to the analysis of various experimental setups that frequently require the use of FCM. Finally, we demonstrate that the data accuracy is preserved when Freecyto is compared to conventional FCM software."," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None
4,2011.08185,Assistive Diagnostic Tool for Brain Tumor Detection using Computer Vision,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08185,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08185,Sahithi Ankireddy,"Today, over 700,000 people are living with brain tumors in the United States. Brain tumors can spread very quickly to other parts of the brain and the spinal cord unless necessary preventive action is taken. Thus, the survival rate for this disease is less than 40% for both men and women. A conclusive and early diagnosis of a brain tumor could be the difference between life and death for some. However, brain tumor detection and segmentation are tedious and time-consuming processes as it can only be done by radiologists and clinical experts. The use of computer vision techniques, such as Mask R Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R CNN), to detect and segment brain tumors can mitigate the possibility of human error while increasing prediction accuracy rates. The goal of this project is to create an assistive diagnostics tool for brain tumor detection and segmentation. Transfer learning was used with the Mask R CNN, and necessary parameters were accordingly altered, as a starting point. The model was trained with 20 epochs and later tested. The prediction segmentation matched 90% with the ground truth. This suggests that the model was able to perform at a high level. Once the model was finalized, the application running on Flask was created. The application will serve as a tool for medical professionals. It allows doctors to upload patient brain tumor MRI images in order to receive immediate results on the diagnosis and segmentation for each patient."," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None

In this work, we introduce a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) web service to detect COVID- 19 online. One of the largest public chest CT-scan databases, containing 746 participants was used in this experiment. A number of well-known deep neural network architectures consisting of ResNet, Inception and MobileNet were inspected to find the most efficient model for the hybrid system. A combination of the Densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) in order to reduce image dimensions and Nu-SVM as an anti-overfitting bottleneck was chosen to distinguish between COVID-19 and healthy controls.

In response to this escalating crisis, efforts to stop poaching using hidden cameras, drones and DNA tracking have been implemented with varying degrees of success. Limited resources, costs and logistical limitations are often the cause of most unsuccessful poaching interventions. The study presented in this paper outlines a flexible and interoperable framework for the automatic detection of animals and poaching activity to facilitate early intervention practices. Using a robust deep learning pipeline, a convolutional neural network is trained and implemented to detect rhinos and cars (considered an important tool in poaching for fast access and artefact transportation in natural habitats) in the study, that are found within live video streamed from drones Transfer learning with the Faster RCNN Resnet 101 is performed to train a custom model with 350 images of rhinos and 350 images of cars. Inference is performed using a frame sampling technique to address the required trade-off control precision and processing speed and maintain synchronisation with the live feed. Inference models are hosted on a web platform using flask web serving, OpenCV and TensorFlow 1.13. Video streams are transmitted from a DJI Mavic Pro 2 drone using the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RMTP).

A case study has been set up and analysed, which consists of a two years long record of IASI spectra over sea surface in the Pacific Ocean close to the Mauna Loa (Hawaii) validation station. IASI O3 products have been intercompared with OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) O3 retrievals, which, in contrast to IASI that uses the thermal infrared, are based on observation in the near ultra violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. IASI OCS retrievals are compared to in situ flask observations. The IASI vs OMI comparison shows an excellent agreement with a correlation of 0.97 and a relative bias of approximately 1 Dobson Unit. For the case of OCS, we have found a good correlation of 0.75 for night time soundings. IASI captures the OCS seasonal cycle, although a relatively large negative bias of approximately -74 pptv is seen, which can be explained with a large spectroscopic error for OCS in the HITRAN 2008 version."," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None

Abdalla, Benjamin Joachimi","It is common practice in cosmology to model large-scale structure observables as lognormal random fields, and this approach has been successfully applied in the past to the matter density and weak lensing convergence fields separately. We argue that this approach has fundamental limitations which prevent its use for jointly modelling these two fields since the lognormal distribution's shape can prevent certain correlations to be attainable. Given the need of ongoing and future large-scale structure surveys for fast joint simulations of clustering and weak lensing, we propose two ways of overcoming these limitations. The first approach slightly distorts the power spectra of the fields using one of two algorithms that minimises either the absolute or the fractional distortions. The second one is by obtaining more accurate convergence marginal distributions, for which we provide a fitting function, by integrating the lognormal density along the line of sight. The latter approach also provides a way to determine directly from theory the skewness of the convergence distribution and, therefore, the parameters for a lognormal fit. We present the public code Full-sky Lognormal Astro-fields Simulation Kit (FLASK) which can make tomographic realisations on the sphere of an arbitrary number of correlated lognormal or Gaussian random fields by applying either of the two proposed solutions, and show that it can create joint simulations of clustering and lensing with sub-per-cent accuracy over relevant angular scales and redshift ranges."," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None

In the second approach, the scintillator was loaded with 2% of $^{\mathrm{nat}}$Sm providing an $α$-emitter, $^{147}$Sm, as an internal source. In the third approach, a scintillator flask was deployed into the water-filled SNO+ detector and the radioactive contaminants $^{222}$Rn, $^{218}$Po and $^{214}$Po provided the $α$-particle signal. The behavior of the observed $α$-particle light outputs are in agreement with each case successfully described by Birks' law.

Such recognition is essential for estimation of fill-level, volume and phase-boundaries as well as for tracking of such chemical processes as precipitation, crystallization, condensation, evaporation and phase-separation. The problem of material boundary recognition in images is particularly complex for materials with non-flat surfaces, i.e., solids, powders and viscous fluids, in which the material interfaces have unpredictable shapes. This work demonstrates a general method for finding the boundaries of materials inside transparent containers in images. The method uses an image of the transparent vessel containing the material and the boundary of the vessel in this image. The recognition is based on the assumption that the material boundary appears in the image in the form of a curve (with various constraints) whose endpoints are both positioned on the vessel contour. The probability that a curve matches the material boundary in the image is evaluated using a cost function based on some image properties along this curve. Several image properties were examined as indicators for the material boundary. The optimal boundary curve was found using Dijkstra's algorithm. The method was successfully examined for recognition of various types of phase-boundaries, including liquid-air, solid-air and solid-liquid interfaces, as well as for various types of glassware containers from everyday life and the chemistry laboratory (i.e., bottles, beakers, flasks, jars, columns, vials and separation-funnels).

This especially invokes an analysis addressing what it would be when the scale of application increases beyond that of the laboratory flask. This point is of primary importance when fashionable nano-scale magnetite particles are used for sorption.

These are all of finite length and the Casimir force can be analyzed and in principle accurately computed without resorting to regularization or analytic continuation. The world-line analysis is robust with respect to variations in the shape of the piston and the flask and the analogy with long-range forces suggests that neutral atoms and particles are also drawn into open-ended pipes (or nano-tubes) by Casimir forces of electromagnetic origin.," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None

Richardson","The behavior of the single-species reaction process $A+A\to O$ is examined near an impenetrable boundary, representing the flask containing the reactants. Two types of dynamics are considered for the reactants: diffusive and ballistic propagation. It is shown that the effect of the boundary is quite different in both cases: diffusion-reaction leads to a density excess, whereas ballistic annihilation exhibits a density deficit, and in both cases the effect is not localized at the boundary but penetrates into the system. The field-theoretic renormalization group is used to obtain the universal properties of the density excess in two dimensions and below for the reaction-diffusion system. In one dimension the excess decays with the same exponent as the bulk and is found by an exact solution. In two dimensions the excess is marginally less relevant than the bulk decay and the density profile is again found exactly for late times from the RG-improved field theory. The results obtained for the diffusive case are relevant for Mg$^{2+}$ or Cd$^{2+}$ doping in the TMMC crystal's exciton coalescence process and also imply a surprising result for the dynamic magnetization in the critical one-dimensional Ising model with a fixed spin. For the case of ballistic reactants, a model is introduced and solved exactly in one dimension. The density-deficit profile is obtained, as is the density of left and right moving reactants near the impenetrable boundary."," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None
23,hep-ph/9807512,Modelling Sonoluminescence,https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9807512,https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9807512,"Alan Chodos, Sarah Groff","In single-bubble sonoluminescence, a bubble trapped by a sound wave in a flask of liquid is forced to expand and contract; exactly once per cycle, the bubble emits a very sharp ($< 50 ps$) pulse of visible light. This is a robust phenomenon observable to the naked eye, yet the mechanism whereby the light is produced is not well understood. One model that has been proposed is that the light is ""vacuum radiation"" generated by the coupling of the electromagnetic fields to the surface of the bubble. In this paper, we simulate vacuum radiation by solving Maxwell's equations with an additional term that couples the field to the bubble's motion. We show that, in the static case originally considered by Casimir, we reproduce Casimir's result. In a simple purely time-dependent example, we find that an instability occurs and the pulse of radiation grows exponentially. In the more realistic case of spherically-symmetric bubble motion, we again find exponential growth in the context of a small-radius approximation."," 8 February, 2021",stat.APastro-ph.IM,None
