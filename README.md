# Clustered-two-level-summarization-of-multiple-research-sites-based-on-TF-IDF-and-Gensim-Word2vec-model

Since, the rise of natural language processing and the field of text summarization. A lot of research has been done to help achieve better results and strategies, through the usage of different summarization techniques. Through usage of such techniques, it is possible to achieve (do) the sentiment analysis of an article and also by making use of various machine learning techniques to achieve keyword generation. As computing power increases, the ease to summarize automatically using various tools also increases. In this paper, keywords are generated from research papers of Arvix and Google scholar, and a database based on these research papers. Usage of TF-IDF methodology in scoring the keyword is made use of, Similarly natural language techniques such as NLTK, Gensim and Sklearn are implemented in the proposed solution.
